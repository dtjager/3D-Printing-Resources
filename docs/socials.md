For now, I have not included (or tried not to) any links to discord, twitter or facebook groups etc. I have tried to keep links to resources to github, manufacturer documentation, or webpages in the hopes that they will be mostly static or at least updated with the most recent information.

If you are having trouble and genuinely cannot resolve it, most of those places have people with an incredible amount of experience who know what they are doing. There is a discord, twitter or facebook group for everything. Find one and ask. If you present your problem, and what you have attempted so far to remedy it, you will generally receive help without issue.
